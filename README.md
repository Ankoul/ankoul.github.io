# MVP for Conectare startup - Online menu for restaurants, bars and places

This project used: Bootstrap 3 Starter Project Folder - https://jacoblett.github.io/Sparky/
Content: Bootstrap Sass + Custom scripts and styles + Grunt 

## Concept

The idea of the MVP was to show users an online menu with foods, drinks and deserts, as well as special deals to see how the user felt using a digital menu and if that solved a problem of having to reach waiters for the menu with also the possibility of looking before going to the place (check deals/offers of the day etc). 

The main metric to follow would be: online visits X physical visits. This would give a perspective on demand and consumption, that should be followed by interviews with users to collect feedback and prospect on next features (order food online, pay online, share bill with friends etc).
